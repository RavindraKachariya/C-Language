Q.1 Write a Program to perform the merge operation of two 1D arrays & store it in another array. Keep in mind that both array sizes can be different.
For example,
Input:
Enter array A's size: 5

Enter array A's elements:
a[0] = 7
a[1] = 4
a[2] = 9
a[3] = 5
a[4] = 2

Enter array B's size: 3

Enter array B's elements:
b[0] = 1
b[1] = 3
b[2] = 6

Output:
Array C is: 7, 4, 9, 5, 2, 1, 3, 6


Q.2 Write a Program to find leap years between two given numbers and store them in an array. And then print that array.
For example,
Input:
Enter the first number: 2020

Enter the second number: 2040

Output:
The array is: 2020, 2024, 2028, 2032, 2036, 2040


Q.3 Write a Program to find square of each element from the given array.
For example,
Input:
Enter array size: 5

Enter array elements:
a[0] = 7
a[1] = 4
a[2] = 9
a[3] = 5
a[4] = 2


Output:
The squares are: 49, 16, 81, 25, 4
